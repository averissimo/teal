\subsection{Introduction}{

The \code{teal} framework introduced the Delayed Data Loading mechanism to enhance the user experience while reading and loading data in the app.
}

\subsection{Background}{

Usually, when running a shiny app, the dataset must be immediately available in the session for processing and reading. However, if the data is stored externally (such as in a database or other data repository), loading the shiny app may be delayed because the data needs to be fetched first.
If there is additional data processing code, this may further extend the loading process.

To address this, we created the Delayed Data Loading mechanism. Learn how to use it \href{https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.data/latest-tag/articles/using-delayed-data-basic.html}{here}.
}

\subsection{What is Delayed Data Loading?}{

Delayed Data Loading is an R object managed in \code{teal.data}, which stores instructions on how to obtain the data, including how to read and process it before it is used in \code{teal}.
By adopting this approach, \code{teal} apps can load more quickly, and the data can be fetched after the app is loaded.
}

\subsection{Splash Screen}{

\code{teal} provides a comprehensive solution for managing the delayed data loading mechanism, which includes the incorporation of a splash screen.
The splash screen serves as a visual cue to the user that data is being loaded and that they should wait for the app to be ready.

Moreover, the splash screen can be modified to query the user for a password or other access credentials needed to fetch the data.
In cases where the modified splash screen is used, \code{teal} will display the customized version to prompt the user for the necessary information.

After the data is fetched and loaded, \code{teal} removes the splash screen and replaces it with the content of the corresponding \code{teal} modules.
\code{teal} also displays a notification indicating that the data has been loaded, and the app has fully started up.
