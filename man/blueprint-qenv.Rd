\subsection{Introduction}{

Reproducibility is paramount in the pharmaceutical industry.
Accurate and consistent results are essential to ensure high-quality research and the safety of patients.
By prioritizing reproducibility, researchers can validate their methods, confirm their findings, and contribute to the advancement of the field.

\code{qenv} is an essential feature provided by the \code{teal.code} R package that simplifies code reproducibility.
It is an R object that contains both code and environment, enabling the easy sharing and replication of R code.
The R code is passed to the qenv object, which holds and evaluates it upon request.

\subsection{\code{qenv} in a \code{teal} application}{

In a \code{teal} application, the \code{qenv} object is created by the module developer when implementing the necessary logic for the module. In essence, it is a wrapper of the module's logic that allows the R code for the analysis to be inspected and reproducible outside the teal application. It includes the required libraries, filtering information and logic.

The \code{qenv} object makes it easy for users to reproduce and validate the results of their analyses.

\subsection{\verb{Show R Code} and \code{Reporter}}{

The \code{qenv} object is used to support the module's visualizations, such as textual information, tables and plots. Additionally it also supports:
\enumerate{
\item The \verb{Show R Code} button
\item The \code{Reporter} feature
}

The former allows users to inspect the contents of the \code{qenv} object, enabling them to closely analyze and replicate the module's analysis.
The latter utilizes the \code{qenv} object to merge multiple \code{qenv} objects from various \code{teal} modules, resulting in a downloadable report with reproducible results that ensures accurate and consistent data presentations.
